Permutation

This code for permutation. The logic to solve the problem is using "Backtracking" algorithm with time complexity (O(n * n!)). The main function is output the "list of the permutation" with similar integer case like:
1. 1234 is similar with 1324
2. 12 is similar with 12
3. 123 is not similar with 234 (There are different sets of digit).
4. 113 is not similar with 123
